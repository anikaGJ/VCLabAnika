## Miscellany
**Why we chose the following:**

**Code of Conduct**: We chose the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct because it harbors a safe and inclusive social and progamming environment. Contributors must refrain from changing the software in a way that is harmful or hurtful to either the software or the users of the software. For our fortune-telling program, this is essential because we don't want anyone changing the printed fortunes to be rude or harmful statements.

**LICENSE**: We chose the MIT License because it preserves our copyright but we also did not want to limit our contributers to what they are allowed to do with our code. This license also has the ability to work with other distributed licenses, which again is a big deal to the little restrictions we want to give to our contributers.
